# Recommendation_system

I and my team have developed a web application using React, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL to create a recommendation system as our DBMS project. The application showcases various product categories such as Mobile phones, Laptops, Mobile backcovers, Mobile stands, pendrives, and more on the home page. When a user clicks on a specific product, they are directed to a new page displaying all the details of that product. Using MySQL query logic, the application fetches and displays related products below the product details, including accessories.

In the recommendation section, I have implemented additional logic to display products with prices greater than or equal to the currently viewed product. This personalized approach ensures that users are presented with relevant options within their desired price range. The application also utilizes the PUT APIs of Node.js to update the user's buylist in a MySQL table to update quantity in both productlist and buylist table.
Also it show message when only few items are left in stock. Here are few snippets.
